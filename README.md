Algorithms used: k-NN,sklearn and Decision Tree
Dataset: Heart Disease dataset from UCI repository

The purpose of building this project is to visualize and analyse the dataset for 
different features of data. 
Analysis of dataset is done using Numpy, Pandas and sklearn libraries.
Vizualization of data is done using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

The analytics shows that k-NN shows greater accuracy than Decision-Tree algorithms.

Firslty the dataset is taken from UCI repository and cleaned. I have checked for null 
values if exists, then the dataset is visualized to understand the dataset clearly.
Then the dataset is trained to check the accuracy of different algorithms.
